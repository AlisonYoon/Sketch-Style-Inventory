# Style Inventory for Sketch

Design requires free, sometimes chaotic exploration. But design also means organisation and structure. Sketch can be good in both aspects, but moving from exploration to structured layouts with text styles and unified colors is hard. Either you start clean files from scratch, or you use what you have and try to tidy it up. The Style Inventory is meant to help you with that. It gives you an overview of all your used styles and helps you to merge styles of similar layers into one. This repositiory also contains a few other helpful plugins.

## Installation

To install all plugins, [download](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Style-Inventory/archive/master.zip) them all first, unzip the archive, and place the folder contents in your Sketch Plugins folder by navigating to `Sketch > Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder…`

To install only a selection of plugins, you will first need to place the library file `inventory.js` in the root of your Sketch Plugins directory. This is very important as all plugins rely on its functionality.

You can then install selected plugins by double-clicking the file, or alternatively, drag and drop the file onto the Sketch app icon. This will automatically copy the plugin to your Sketch Plugins folder.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most plugins have a pre-defined keyboard shortcut. You can always change it by editing the shortcut written in parenthesis at the end of the first line of a plugin.

For example, the first line of `Duplicate Artboard.sketchplugin`:

> // Duplicates the current artboard right next to it. (shift command d)

You can use modifier keys such as `option`, `command`, `control`, `shift`

## Artboards

### Duplicate Artboard (next to the current artboard)

This improves the built in behavior of artboard duplication in Sketch. If the selected artboard is in the middle of other artboards, all artboards on the right side will be shifted to the right before the artboard is duplicated. Requires any layer of an artboard to be selected.

**Shortcut:** `shift` + `⌘` + `D`

### Remove Artboard

This improves the built in behavior of artboard removal in Sketch. If the selected artboard is in the middle of other artboards, all artboards on the right side will be shifted to the left after the artboard has been removed. Requires any layer of an artboard to be selected.

**Shortcut:** `⌘` + `⌫` (Backspace)

## Style Inventory
Generate a visual style sheet with all colors and text styles that you are using. This will help you to get an overview of your used styles so you can merge styles that are very close together. This will also export a CSS file with text styles.
